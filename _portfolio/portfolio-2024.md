The study involves training and evaluating three deep learning models SUNSET, Unet, and SolarNet for forecasting solar irradiance up to 15 future timestamps (with 1â€“2 minute resolution), followed by model improvement. The preprocessing pipeline includes fisheye distortion correction and region of interest (RoI) extraction from sky images, followed by cloud mask generation.
