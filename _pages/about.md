GenAI is a research group at Chulalongkorn University under [Data Analytics (DTA)](https://ee.eng.chula.ac.th/data-analytics-dta/). 

Our activities are 

- academic reasearch for deep learning-based solutions. See [*Research Groups*](https://genai.cuee.io/portfolio) for the recent works done by undergraduate students.  

- academic lectures in machine learning and data analytics. See [*Teaching*](https://genai.cuee.io/teaching). 

- AI-based solutions solutions to those who are interested. See [*Publications*](https://genai.cuee.io/Publications) for our past works done in the industries. The work experience is also provided in [*CV*](https://genai.cuee.io/CV).  

- Moreover, we often collaborate with [energyCUEE](https://github.com/energyCUEE) led by [Professor Jitkomut Songsiri](http://jitkomut.eng.chula.ac.th/) for the AI-based solution in solar energy. 

Our github page: [https://github.com/GenAI-CUEE](https://github.com/GenAI-CUEE) will also be consistently updated to provide the materials for the students.
