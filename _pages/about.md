 [*Research Groups*](https://genai.cuee.io/portfolio) for the recent works done by undergraduate students.  

- academic lectures in machine learning and data analytics. 

 [*Teaching*](https://genai.cuee.io/teaching) for the course materials in Estimation Theory and Statististical Modeling and Inference. 

- AI-based solutions solutions to those who are interested.  

 [*Publications*](https://genai.cuee.io/Publications) provides our past works done in the industries.  

- My work experience is also provided in [*CV*](https://genai.cuee.io/CV).  

Our github page: https://github.com/GenAI-CUEE will also be consistently updated to provide the materials for the students.   

Moreover, we often collaborate with [energyCUEE](https://github.com/energyCUEE) led by [Professor Jitkomut Songsiri](http://jitkomut.eng.chula.ac.th/) for the AI-based solution in solar energy.
